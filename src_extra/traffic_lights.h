* Description: This source file contains functions used to drive the 7 segment display. 
* Therearethreefunctionsinthisfile. ThedisplayNumber()functionreceivesan unsigned16-bitinteger. 
* Itisusedtoassignthedigitnumberandthevaluetobedisplayed perdigitwhenthetimerinterruptoccurs. 
* ThecalculateDigits()functionisusedtoextract the digits (of which a maximum of four can be displayed) 
* from the number to be displayed. The hwTimerISR() (which is defined in the xinterruptES3.c file) method 
* is used to call the displayDigit() method, which selects the segments and displays the digits on the 
* 7-segment display. All these functions are declared in the seg7_display.h header file.
