* Target Device/Platform: Basys3 Board (with Microblaze processor on the Artix-7 FPGA)
* Tool Version: Xilinx SDK 2015.2
* Name: Yunong Liu
* Company: University of Edinburgh
* Creation Date and Time: 20/11/2021; 07:23
* Description: This source file contains functions used to display informations of traffic lights
* on VGA, LEDS and also 4-digit-7-segment display. The pd_cross() is used to display the actions
* during the pedestrians cross the road and roads_loop() is used to display normal road loop.
* All these functions are declared in the display_control.h header file.
